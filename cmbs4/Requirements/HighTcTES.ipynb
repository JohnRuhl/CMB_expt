    "# High-Tc (Calibration) TES requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "1/27/2024, J. Ruhl\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook discusses and derives requirements on CMB-S4's high Tc (calibration) TES's.\n",
    "Many parameters are taken from the \"2023 Design Freeze\" spreadsheet, available here:\n",
    "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ui0b_YdOvcJ46ZFtYtBoETM401FUswg2pM4sBj2H3JQ/edit?usp=drive_link\n",
    "\n",
    "## Purpose\n",
    "The calibration TES's will be used for two purposes:\n",
    "1. Optical testing of bare modules, including band, beam and polarization tests, will be used to select modules for deployment, and as feedback to fabrication.\n",
    "1. Optical testing of the fully assembled receivers/telescopes will be used to calibrate parameters relevant to science analysis.  This includes measurements of passband, polarization, and beam/sidelobe properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "These tests will be done using optical loads that will saturate the science TES transition;  this drives the need for a calibration (high Psat, high Tc) TES in series with the science TES.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "The requirements related to the calibration TES are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It must not saturate under the highest planned optical loading.\n",
    "1. It must be stable under all planned optical loadings.\n",
    "1. The readout system must be capable of biasing a full wafer of detectors under the lowest planned optical loading.\n",
    "1. The cryogenic system must be capable of handling the heat load when a full wafer of detectors is biased.\n",
    "1. The detector response should be sufficiently linear under the planned optical loading range, such that \n",
    "the planned calibrations are possible.\n",
    "1. The calibration TES and science TES should be sufficiently well separated in their parameters ($R_N, T_C, P_{sat}$) that they are easily distinguishable, and do not impact eachothers operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assumptions\n",
    "We calculate the \"planned optical loadings\" under the assumption that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. the module efficiencies, optics effiencies, and bandwidths are as specified in the 2023 design freeze, \n",
    "1. the beam-filling optical load has a maximum of 450K,\n",
    "1. For the LATs, calibrations are assumed to take place in the lab, so the minimum optical loading is 300K.\n",
    "1. For the SATs, beam mapping involves a partially beam filling source, so a beam that is off-source is looking at the cold sky.  We assume here that the minimum total loading is equal to the target science TES P_optical.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Module testing is done without the receiver optics in place;  for that configuration we assume 100% efficiency for the module test cryostat optics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the optical loading is linearly proportional to the module efficiency, which is not a well\n",
    "known number.  We consider the effects of that uncertainty below.\n"

    "# Resistance and T_c\n",
    "\n",
    "We wrote the requirement above that \"the calibration TES and science TES should be sufficiently well separated in their parameters ( 𝑅𝑁,𝑇𝐶,𝑃𝑠𝑎𝑡) that they are easily distinguishable, and do not impact eachothers operation.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The science transition operating point target is $R_{op} = 6$ mOhms.  We assume that TES therefore has $R_{normal} =12$ mOhms.  Therefore, we adopt\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ R_{normal}^{calib} > 2 R_{normal}^{sci} \\ , $$ \n",
    "\n",
    "so that $ R_{normal}^{calib} = 25$ mOhms, with an operating point of about $ R_{op}^{calib} \\approx 20$mOhms.  (We'll use this resistance below in our electrical power estimates).  (The 2023 design spreadsheet said 25mOhms, which I suspect was a holdover from when the expected R_op on the science transition was 8mOhms.)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no official $T_c$ requirement for the science transitions, but in order to meet the dark NET \n",
    "requirements it will need to be roughly 170 mK.  We want to have a normal branch of the science TES visible (mostly for feedback to design iterations) below the calibration TES transition.  To leave room for that, \n",

    "\n",

    "## Deriving Psat requirements from those calculated P_opticals\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest way to set a Psat requirement from the above results would be to say that the Psat must be greater than the maximum value for that telescope and band (which is the module maximum), perhaps adding some margin in case the efficiency or bandwidth of the module was higher than expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "There was concern among the fabrication teams (see Jamie Bock's spreadsheets on this topic) that requiring a large ratio between the calibration TES Psat and the science TES Psat, shown in the tables above on the line \"module/sci ratio\", could lead to problems with stability of the calibration TES transition.  This was (at that time) thought to be a problem mostly for the LAT 90GHz and lower bands (ULF, LF_1, LF_2, MF_1).  Based on that discussion we decided to baseline the use of cold Neutral Density Filters (NDF's) in the LAT module testing, to reduce the optical load there to the level of (or below) that expected with LAT receiver optics in place.  That is:\n",
    "- For the SATs, we based the calibration TES Psat (minimum and target) on the line labelled \"Popt_module_max\" above, \n",
    "- For the LATs, we based the calibration TES Psat (minimum and target) on the line labelled \"Popt_tel_max\" above.\n",
    "\n",
    "In both cases, we set the \"minimum\" to 1.1 times the calculated optical load, and the \"target\" to 1.2 times the calculated optical load.  The table below shows those numbers, which are consistent with the values in the 2023 Design spreadsheet except for the CHLAT (where an error in optical efficiency there led to larger values).\n"

    "Recently, Cesiley King (Johanna Nagy's graduate student) pointed out to me that optical testing done by chopping a beam-filling optical load from 300K to 450K leads to a large fractional optical power swing, and therefore \n",
    "potentially very large fractional electrical power swings on the detector.  For example, if \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P_{opt} = g T_{load}$$\n",
    "and \n",
    "$$ P_{sat} = 1.1 g \\ 450K $$\n",
    "then\n",
    "$$ P_{elec} = P_{sat} - P_{opt} = g (495K - T_{load}) $$\n",
    "so in a beam filling chop between 450K and 300K $P_{elec}$ changes from $45g$ to $195g$, ie by a factor of more than three.  That's a very large fractional swing in electrical power, over which the detector response could be significantly non-linear, which could in turn induce systematic effects in our measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cesiley also estimated NETs for our calibration TES's under 300K optical loading, and found we expect order 1mKrtsec or so.  This suggests that we don't need a \"beam filling 450K to 300K chop\" to get very high signal to noise.  ie, our loads could be beam filling with a $\\Delta T$ of order 10K, or have large $\\Delta T$ but not be beam filling.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For the rest of this document we proceed with the \"450K beam filling load\" requirement and ignore questions of linearity, noting that keeping the electrical power large will help the linearity."

    "The power dissipated at 100mK through the TES's and shunt resistors needs to be manageable.  The dilution refrigerators have order 100uW cooling power at 100mK.  The LATR's have 85 wafers, the SATs have 36 wafers, and the high throughput test cryostats have 7 wafers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The electrical power depends on how much optical power is present.  We have two possible \"low power\" use cases:\n",

The readout system should be able to bias to the calibration transition with the wafer \"dark\", so that we can verify the calibration transition exists and has reasonable properties before investing time in an optical run.  (If this proves to be a difficult requirement to meet, we could omit it at the potential expense of additional runs).  This is only relevant in the HTC cryostats, which have 7 wafer each.\n",
